	Our Vision - When Lisa Ferrazzoli started The International Preschool, she wrote an ideology to
	describe her vision of what she wanted her Preschool to be, and it still hangs on the walls of
	every International Preschool location. It is the foundation of all workings within the
	Preschools and has been the building block of our continued success within the world of early
	childhood education. "To acquaint children with diversity and increase their acceptance of
	dissimilar cultures. To equip them with a strong foundation of knowledge within a multicultural
	microcosm and prepare them to become better world citizens." - Lisa Ferrazzoli
